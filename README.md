# FutureCipherFlow: Decentralized Crypto-Asset Automation API

FutureCipherFlow provides a secure and transparent platform for automating crypto-asset trading strategies through a decentralized API. It leverages the power of WebAssembly (WASM) smart contracts to enable trustless execution and verifiable on-chain settlement, empowering users to deploy sophisticated strategies without relying on centralized intermediaries.

FutureCipherFlow addresses the growing need for sophisticated and transparent crypto-asset management tools. Existing solutions often rely on centralized exchanges or custodial services, introducing counterparty risk and limiting user control. This project offers a unique approach by enabling users to define their trading logic in WASM-based smart contracts. These contracts are deployed on a decentralized network, ensuring that the execution of the strategy is governed by immutable code and verifiable on the blockchain. This provides a high degree of security, transparency, and control for users, allowing them to confidently automate their crypto-asset management. The platform is designed for developers seeking to build automated trading bots, portfolio rebalancing tools, or other sophisticated crypto-asset management applications.

The core benefit of FutureCipherFlow lies in its ability to create a secure and auditable automation environment. By using WASM, we ensure that the execution of trading strategies is deterministic and predictable. Each transaction is recorded on-chain, providing a complete and transparent audit trail. This eliminates the black-box nature of traditional automated trading platforms and gives users full visibility into the decision-making process of their strategies. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of the platform mitigates single points of failure and ensures high availability, making it a reliable solution for managing crypto-assets.

FutureCipherFlow aims to be a modular and extensible platform. The architecture is designed to accommodate different blockchain networks and crypto-asset exchanges. The use of WASM allows for easy integration with various programming languages and frameworks. This flexibility ensures that the platform can adapt to the evolving landscape of the crypto-asset industry and cater to the diverse needs of its users.

## Key Features

*   **WASM Smart Contract Execution:** Define and deploy trading strategies as WebAssembly (WASM) smart contracts. These contracts are executed within a sandboxed environment, ensuring security and determinism. The contracts interact with the platform via a defined ABI (Application Binary Interface).
*   **Verifiable On-Chain Settlement:** All trading actions and settlement processes are recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent and auditable transaction history. This provides users with complete visibility into the execution of their strategies.
*   **Decentralized API Gateway:** Access the platform's functionality through a decentralized API gateway, eliminating reliance on centralized intermediaries and providing a secure and censorship-resistant access point. The API endpoints are secured using cryptographic signatures.
*   **Multi-Exchange Support:** Connect to multiple crypto-asset exchanges through a standardized interface. This allows users to deploy strategies that span across different exchanges and take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The platform currently supports Binance and Coinbase APIs, with plans to integrate more exchanges.
*   **Risk Management Framework:** Implement robust risk management controls within the WASM smart contracts. Define parameters such as stop-loss orders, take-profit levels, and maximum position sizes to mitigate potential losses. The framework also includes circuit breakers to halt trading in volatile market conditions.
*   **On-Chain Data Feeds:** Access real-time market data from decentralized oracles. This ensures that the trading strategies are based on accurate and reliable information. The platform supports Chainlink and Band Protocol as data feed providers.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go (Golang):** The core of the FutureCipherFlow API is written in Go, providing performance, concurrency, and cross-platform compatibility. It's responsible for handling API requests, managing WASM smart contract execution, and interacting with blockchain networks.
*   **CosmWasm:** FutureCipherFlow utilizes CosmWasm to facilitate the creation and deployment of secure and efficient WASM smart contracts. This framework provides a standardized interface for interacting with the underlying blockchain.
*   **gRPC:** gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is used for internal communication between different components of the platform. It provides high-performance and efficient communication through protocol buffers.
*   **Redis:** Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data, such as market data and smart contract states. This improves the performance and responsiveness of the platform.
*   **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for storing user data, smart contract metadata, and transaction history.
*   **Docker:** Docker is used to containerize the different components of the platform, making it easy to deploy and manage in different environments.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/FutureCipherFlow.git
    cd FutureCipherFlow
2.  Install Go dependencies:

    go mod download
3.  Install Docker and Docker Compose.
4.  Set up the environment variables (see Configuration section).
5.  Build the Docker images:

    docker-compose build
6.  Run the application:

    docker-compose up

## Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables to be configured:

*   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for the PostgreSQL database. Example: postgres://user:password@host:port/database
*   `REDIS_URL`: The connection string for the Redis server. Example: redis://:password@host:port/0
*   `BINANCE_API_KEY`: Your Binance API key.
*   `BINANCE_API_SECRET`: Your Binance API secret.
*   `COINBASE_API_KEY`: Your Coinbase API key.
*   `COINBASE_API_SECRET`: Your Coinbase API secret.
*   `COSMWASM_CHAIN_ID`: The chain ID of the CosmWasm network.
*   `COSMWASM_RPC_URL`: The RPC URL of the CosmWasm network.

These environment variables can be set directly in your shell environment or in a `.env` file located in the root directory of the project. The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to load environment variables from a `.env` file if it exists.

## Usage

The FutureCipherFlow API provides endpoints for deploying, managing, and executing WASM smart contracts. Detailed API documentation, including endpoint descriptions, request parameters, and response formats, is available in the `docs/api.md` file in the repository.

Example: Deploying a WASM smart contract:

// Assuming you have a compiled WASM contract at ./contracts/my_contract.wasm
// and the ABI definition at ./contracts/my_contract.abi

// Build the deployment request
type DeployRequest struct {
   ContractName string
   WASMCode []byte
   ABIDefinition []byte
   InitialState map[string]interface{}
}

wasmCode, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("./contracts/my_contract.wasm")
abiDefinition, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("./contracts/my_contract.abi")

request := DeployRequest{
   ContractName: "MyContract",
   WASMCode: wasmCode,
   ABIDefinition: abiDefinition,
   InitialState: map[string]interface{}{"owner": "my_address"},
}

// Send the request to the API endpoint /contracts/deploy

//The response will contain the contract address on the blockchain.
